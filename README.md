# RbxLib
Python library for the Roblox API, built simple for simple projects.
I built this so I could have a basic library to get information from the Roblox API for a Discord Bot.  After finding out there are no good libraries I made this for other devs who may need this.  I hope it's helpful for you.  Open an issue for any bug reports or DM me on discord @ Elmo#2963, or visit my main (Discord)[discord.gg/tfRNz4xNSP] I will have a support channel made in it where you can send your questions.

Final message, thank you for choosing to use my library.


# Documentation

## Importing
Importing will come later as I still need to get it set up on PyPi so give me a little bit to do so.

## doesUserExist(user) | Function

Arguments: user[String/Int]
Example:
```python
print(doesUserExist("TheROBLOXMAPMAKE")) -> True
print(doesUserExist(378776480)) -> True
```
Notes: This function will return `True` or `False` depending on if the user exists or not.
